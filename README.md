## Connections:

Ground and 5V lines go out from the Arduino Nano to the GND and VCC of each DTH11-sensor, as well as to the GND and VCC of the relay module.
The DATA pins on the 3 DHT11 sensors are connected to the MCU's pins 2, 3 and 4.
The IN1, IN2 and IN3 pins on the 4-channel relay board are connected to the MCU's pins 5, 6 and 7 (for the three pairs of heating elements), the IN4 pin on the relay board is connected to the MCU's pin 8 (for the humidifier).

The power cords of the 6 heating elements are cut and one wire of each pair is directly routed to the input power cable.
The other wires of elements 1 and 2 are joined and routed to the Normally Open (NO) contact of relay 1. Those of elements 3 and 4 are routed to the NO contact of relay 2. Those of 5 and 6 are route to the NO contact of relay 3. The Common (C) contacts of relays 1, 2 and 3 are wired to the other wire of the input power cable.

One of the wires of the humidifier power cable goes directly to the input power cable, the other of the two is connected to the NO contact of relay 4. The Common contact of relay 4 is wired to the input power cable.
